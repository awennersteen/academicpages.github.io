I recently found an interests in optimization methods and their applications, which has inspired me also to look at other methods than machine learning.

I Also recently became interested in computational linguistics and natural language processing, which is something I’m currently pursuing.

After a talk by ScyllaDB at CERN, as well as previous attempts at playing with NoSQL and Graph databases, I’ve developed an interest in databases as well, and am sitting in on a course in on advanced topics in the foundations of databases.

Machine learning is becoming ever more powerful and our lives are more and more impacted by the decisions taken by such systems. I am very excited by these development, and I truly believe that we can build a better world this way. Nevertheless, I am worried too. There are issues with bias introduced by such algorithms, further splitting us. Another issue is to ensure that such algorithms are robust, by which I mean that they correctly tackle new events that they have not yet encountered.
On the research side, this needs to be tackled in two ways. One way is to keep building real systems, attempting to bring in the latest research and put it to the test. The other way is through fundamental research. In particular, we do not yet understand well enough how machines learn, or how they should learn. Understanding how the machines fundamentally learn is paramount to ensure that they are fair and robust. 

Lastly, I think more work is needed in code and fundamental algorithm optimization, scalability of algorithms and on the software side for increasing performance of ML frameworks. This will be critical to the adoption of algorithms in industry.


Boring!
======

- You: Please, speak about more fun things. This is just a rehash of your CV!
- Me: Fair point. I also like:

Sports:
------
I used to play volleyball, competing for Bø Volleyball club (now part of Skarphedin) at various levels, the school team, and for Vinje I.L as a playing coach in a junior team we funded. I also taught Volleyball in my high school. I'm also a avid hiker, having grown up in a remote part of Norway nature has always been a part of my life, and I return as often as possibble.

Art:
------
I’m a big art-fan, particularly of national romanticism in Norway and the UK, as well as impressionism, surrealism and early abstract art. I particularly enjoy water-colour paintings, and 

In more contemporary times I’ve been struck the hardest by two figures, very far apart. One being the late Remy Zaugg; whos work I encountred at the Reina Sofia in Madrid, and Raqib Shaw, whom I’ve seen several times in the UK.

I found Remy Zauggs work on perception to be interesting. In a series, rather than painting the painting, Zaugg would write on the canvas the object or colour which belonged there. This piece also connected to my interests in artificial intelligence, as this kind of thinking and context is both very close, and very very far away from computer vision capabilities. It gave a representation, one that was perfectly valid and capable of transmitting just the same information as an actual painting. In a way, similar to how one can thinking of deep learning layers abstracting away layer by layer of its input. Yet, for the machine to achieve this level of sentient, where it will start to question perception, and question the representation in order to create new abstraction, I think is very far away.

I'm far less knowledgeable about architecture and such, although I do have a habit of travelling to place which are rich in older buildings. I'm in general a big history fan,
as a kid I always thought I'd be an archeologist. The highlight of any city trip would be to go to the archeology museum.

Humanities:
======
As I grew older, archeologist was no longer what I wanted to do. But before I decided on my current degree, I actually
considered several options in the humanities. The side of me that like to debate current topics, obsess over philosophical
details, archaic language or historic evolution also like to make the occasional appearance.

Physics and Mathematics
------
I am interested in topological and geometrical theories in physics, primarily condensed matter physics. My master’s thesis is currently being written on ab initio searches for topological insulators. In non-jargon speech: I use computers to combine atoms at random, and watch them form structures. I then look at the allowed energy states for the electrons in the solid. A topological insulator can then be identified by having some unusual properties such as an inverted band structure, i.e. the valence bands and conduction bands have crossed and changed order, and they’ve done such in a way that it forms Mobius band like structures, rather than “trivial” forms like a regular annulus. A interesting way of phrasing this is that I'm researching ways for the energy gap could avoid being topologically equivalent to the vacuum.

My favourite movement these days is category and topos theory. I took a course in Edinburgh on categorical quantum mechanics, and followed that up with organising a small reading group
on topological quantum field theory - I was totally blown away. I recommend everyone to read John Baez' (Physics, Topology, logic and Computation: A Rosetta stone)[math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf].
