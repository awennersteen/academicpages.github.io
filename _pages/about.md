Hi,

My name is Aleksander Wennersteen, high performance computing aficionado with particular interest in distributed and heterogeneous systems, large-scale algorithms and optimization theory. I have decided not to pursue academia due to the current state of post PhD opportunities, lack of funding and a sincere belief that, considering my interests, I can achieve just as much outside academia with the amazing opportunities available today.

I’ve worked in CERNs HPC group on containerised HPC, in the extremescale algorithms and visualisation groups at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center on deep learning and Monte Carlo assisted crowd simulations, and with particle physicists from Edinburgh, Brookhaven and Nvidia on accelerating lattice QCD with GPUs.

I’ve been trained in HPC through the EPCC master and Archer/PRACE courses and IT4I in the Czech Republic, learning various techniques in HPC ranging from MPI and OpenMP, through PGAS model languages, GPUs, computer architectures and performance considerations as well as big data techniques like the analytics engine Apache Spark. Lastly I’ve had a 1 week intensive summer school, PUMPS, in Barcelona which covered advanced GPU programming techniques and applications to both scientific codes and deep learning optimization such as memory considerations in linear algebra.

Further, I am interested in topological and geometrical theories in physics, primarily condensed matter physics. My master’s thesis is currently being written on ab initio searches for topological insulators. In non-jargon speech: I use computers to combine atoms at random, and watch them form structures. I then look at the allowed energy states for the electrons in the solid. A topological insulator can then be identified by having some unusual properties such as an inverted band structure, i.e. the valence bands and conduction bands have crossed and changed order, and they’ve done such in a way that it forms Mobius band like structures, rather than “trivial” forms like a regular annulus. A interesting way of phrasing this is that I'm researching ways for the energy gap could avoid being topologically equivalent to the vacuum.

I hope start working on open source projects upon graduating, as I think this is one of the best ways of making a difference in the software world. This view was strongly reinforced in the past year, where I first got first-hand experience with a large-scale organisation centred around open source software as an openlab summer student at CERN. I then attended the Linux foundations open source software conference where I was further introduced to the amazing community in the OSS world.
