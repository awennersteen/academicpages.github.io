My name is Aleksander Wennersteen, high performance computing aficionado with particular interest in distributed and heterogeneous systems, cloud computing, large-scale algorithms and optimisation theory with their applications in machine learning/AI.
I'm available for consulting and contract work, although I'm not available long-term full time. See the [Hire Me](hire) section.


Iâ€™ve worked in CERNs HPC group on containerised HPC, in the extremescale algorithms and visualisation groups at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center on deep learning and Monte Carlo assisted crowd simulations, and with particle physicists from Edinburgh, Brookhaven and Nvidia on accelerating lattice QCD with GPUs. 
My Senior Honours and MPhys projects (think BSc and MSc projects) were both within theoretical condensed matter physics.. 
For more look at my [CV](cv).


I'm educated in Mathematical Physics (MPhys) from The University of Edinburgh where I wrote my master's thesis on topological insulators. Apart from studing the theoretical and
mathematical foundations, I did density functional theory calclations to search for a novel topological insulators, found none but found a potential new material
Sb2Se5 and showed that it potentially favourable, once formed, in a high pressure range of 30-50 GPa.


I hope to  start working on open source projects upon graduating, as I think this is one of the best ways of making a difference in the software world.
This view was strongly reinforced in the past year, where I got a first-hand experience with a large-scale organisation centred around open source software as an openlab summer student at CERN.
I then attended the Linux foundations open source software conference where I was further introduced to the amazing community in the OSS world.
