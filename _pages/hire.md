I am open to consulting opportunities.

My experience is in HPC and numerically heavy algorithms, and I can offer consultation in the area of HPC, ranging from scalability tests of software, code parallelisation, exploring and porting code to new architectures and acquiring HPC systems, and of course training in HPC techniques, use of MPI, openMP, GPU programming, and use of various tools to examine the performance of your code, e.g. cache usage, memory patterns, threading etc.
Do not hesitate to contact me for more in-depth discussions.
